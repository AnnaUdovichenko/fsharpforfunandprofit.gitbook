In this series, you'll learn what computation expressions are, some common patterns, and how to make your own. In the process, we'll also look at continuations, the bind function, wrapper types, and more.




* [Computation expressions: Introduction](../posts/computation-expressions-intro.md). Unwrapping the enigma....
* [Understanding continuations](../posts/computation-expressions-continuations.md). How 'let' works behind the scenes.
* [Introducing 'bind'](../posts/computation-expressions-bind.md). Steps towards creating our own 'let!' .
* [Computation expressions and wrapper types](../posts/computation-expressions-wrapper-types.md). Using types to assist the workflow.
* [More on wrapper types](../posts/computation-expressions-wrapper-types-part2.md). We discover that even lists can be wrapper types.
* [Implementing a builder: Zero and Yield](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part1.md). Getting started with the basic builder methods.
* [Implementing a builder: Combine](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part2.md). How to return multiple values at once.
* [Implementing a builder: Delay and Run](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part3.md). Controlling when functions execute.
* [Implementing a builder: Overloading](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part4.md). Stupid method tricks.
* [Implementing a builder: Adding laziness](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part5.md). Delaying a workflow externally.
* [Implementing a builder: The rest of the standard methods](../posts/computation-expressions-builder-part6.md). Implementing While, Using, and exception handling.
