In this series, we'll look at how so-called "applicative parsers" work. In order to understand something, there's nothing
like building it for yourself, and so we'll create a basic parser library from scratch, then some useful "parser combinators",
and then finish off by building a complete JSON parser.


* [Understanding Parser Combinators](../posts/understanding-parser-combinators.md). Building a parser combinator library from scratch.
* [Building a useful set of parser combinators](../posts/understanding-parser-combinators-2.md). 15 or so combinators that can be combined to parse almost anything.
* [Improving the parser library](../posts/understanding-parser-combinators-3.md). Adding more informative errors.
* [Writing a JSON parser from scratch](../posts/understanding-parser-combinators-4.md). In 250 lines of code.
