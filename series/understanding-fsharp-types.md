F# is not just about functions; the powerful type system is another key ingredient.  And just as with functions, understanding the type system is critical to being fluent and comfortable in the language. 

In addition to the common .NET types. F# has some other types that are very common in functional languages but not available in imperative languages like C# or Java.

This series introduces these types and how to use them.
